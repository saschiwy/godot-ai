"""Source-structure regression tests for the create_script -> attach_script
import-settle fix (issue #261).

Without this guard, an agent that calls `script_create` followed immediately
by `script_attach` for the same `.gd` file races the editor's filesystem
scan: `ResourceLoader.exists(path)` can return false while Godot is still
recognising the new resource. The fix is to defer the `script_create`
response until either the resource is visible or a bounded settle window
elapses, so a successful response means an immediate `script_attach` will
succeed.

These tests pin the structure so a future refactor can't silently regress
the guarantee.
