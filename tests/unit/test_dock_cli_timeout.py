"""Source-structure regression tests for the wall-clock-bounded CLI fix.

Issues #238 / #239: a hung `claude mcp list` was wedging the dock's
status refresh worker for 6+ minutes; the Configure / Remove buttons hit
the same root cause on the editor main thread. The fix is layered:

1. `McpCliExec.run` wraps every shell-out in an `OS.execute_with_pipe` +
   poll/`OS.kill` loop with a hard wall-clock budget.
2. `McpCliStrategy` uses the helper from configure / remove / status —
   no direct `OS.execute(..., true)` call survives.
3. The dock dispatches Configure / Remove to a per-row worker thread
   instead of running on main, with the existing in-flight UI pattern
   already used by status refresh.

These tests lock the structure in so a future "simplify" pass can't
silently regress either issue.
