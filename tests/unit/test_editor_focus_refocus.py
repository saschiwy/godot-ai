    Deterministic replacement for the prior 1.5s settle timer (#234), with
    every per-client status probe (JSON / TOML / CLI alike) routed through
    the existing worker so cold-start dock paint isn't blocked behind ~16
    sync `FileAccess.open` + `JSON.parse_string` calls.

    The race: Godot's lazy GDScript hot-reload of overwritten plugin files
    swaps bytecode on first dereference. A worker spawned from a fresh
    `_build_ui` walks straight into `_json_strategy.*` / `_cli_strategy.*` /
    `client_configurator.*` mid-swap → SIGABRT (#233).

    The fix: dereference every script the worker will touch on the main
    thread *before* the worker starts. After this helper, bytecode is
    stable everywhere the worker reaches → no race possible.

      • A single explicit `_warm_strategy_bytecode()` call invokes a
        pure-memory helper (no disk, no `OS.execute`) on each strategy
        script — `_json_strategy.gd`, `_toml_strategy.gd`, `_cli_strategy.gd`
        — plus `client_configurator.gd` via `client_ids()` / `get_by_id`.
      • `client_status_probe_snapshot` (called per client on main) builds
        the per-row probe envelope with the `installed` flag and (for CLI
        clients) the cached CLI path.
      • Every probe — JSON, TOML and CLI — is then handed to the same
        worker thread that already handles CLI probes. Disk reads + JSON
        parses for the ~17 non-CLI clients now happen off the main thread.

    The structural assertions below lock in this contract: a future "make
    startup snappier" refactor can't drop the explicit warming step
    (re-introducing #233's race), and a future "be more conservative"
    refactor can't move the per-client status reads back on-thread
    (regressing #228's responsiveness fix and re-blocking the cold paint).

    Race B regression: focus-in landing in the extract→reload window of
    the install path previously spawned a fresh worker that walked into a
    half-overwritten plugin script and SIGABRT'd inside
    `GDScriptFunction::call` (observed in `Godot-2026-04-27-134236.ips`).
    Workers ALREADY running when install starts hit the same crash because
    the script being mid-`callp` gets its bytecode swapped under it.

    The fix has two parts that must both be present, both in the right order
    (before the write loop, after the symlink-safety early-return):

      1. `_install_in_flight = true`  — gates `_request_client_status_refresh`
         and `_perform_initial_client_status_refresh` so focus-in / cooldown /
         manual-button paths cannot spawn a new worker during the window.
      2. `_drain_dock_workers()` — synchronously joins the currently-running
         workers BEFORE we touch any plugin file on disk. The dock exposes
         `_drain_client_status_refresh_workers()` and
         `_drain_client_action_workers()`; the manager calls both.

    The install pipeline lives on `McpUpdateManager::_install_zip`, so
    this test reads the manager. The dock's gate is
    `_is_self_update_in_progress()` which consults the manager's flag.
