"""Unit tests for the FAILED_MIXED self-update diagnostic in `editor_state`.

The plugin's `update_mixed_state.gd` scanner attaches a structured
`mixed_state` Dictionary to the GDScript `get_editor_state` response when
`addons/godot_ai/` contains `*.update_backup` files left behind by a
self-update whose rollback couldn't restore the previous addon contents
(`UpdateReloadRunner.InstallStatus.FAILED_MIXED`). These tests pin the
Python-side passthrough so an MCP agent observing the field can rely on
its presence and shape without having to probe the plugin directly.

See issue #354 / audit-v2 #10. The GDScript scanner itself is exercised
by `test_project/tests/test_update_mixed_state.gd`.
