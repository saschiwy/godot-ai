_DESCRIPTION = """\
Editor selection, performance monitors, quit, log clearing, game eval.

Resource forms (prefer for active-session reads):
  godot://editor/state, godot://selection/current, godot://performance

Ops:
  • state()
        Editor version, project name, current scene, readiness, play state.
  • selection_get()
        Currently selected node paths in the editor.
  • selection_set(paths)
        Replace the selection with the given list of scene paths.
  • monitors_get(monitors=None)
        Performance singleton values (FPS, memory, draw calls, etc.). Pass
        a list of monitor names to filter; None returns everything.
  • quit()
        Gracefully quit the Godot editor on next frame.
  • logs_clear()
        Clear the MCP log buffer. Returns lines_cleared.
  • game_eval(code)
        Execute GDScript in the running game with return values. Uses
        'await' so user code can await internally. Runtime errors are not
        caught — if eval times out, check logs_read(source='game') for
        push_error output."""

        Picking a source: the default ``"viewport"`` only works for a 3D-rooted

        if the scene has a Camera3D, or open a 3D scene first.

        Sources:
        - "viewport" (default): editor 3D viewport. Requires a 3D-rooted scene
          currently being edited; see above for the 2D / no-scene error shape.
        - "cinematic": render edited scene through its current Camera3D
          (no editor gizmos). Requires a Camera3D in the scene; NODE_NOT_FOUND
          if none is marked ``current``.
        - "game": running game's framebuffer (only when project is running).

        ``include_image=True`` (default) returns an MCP ImageContent block.
        ``view_target`` (comma-separated Node3D paths) reframes editor camera;
