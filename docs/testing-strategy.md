# Godot AI — Testing Strategy

*Updated 2026-04-16*

This document defines how Godot AI should prove that new capability is real, stable, and safe to extend.

Use the related docs for adjacent concerns:

- [implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md) for active priorities
- [packaging-distribution.md](packaging-distribution.md) for release-smoke install coverage

---

## Quality Standard

New capability should not count as shipped just because it works once in a local editor.

The minimum bar is:

- clear tool contract
- automated coverage where the behavior is deterministic
- at least one real-project smoke path for meaningful editor workflows
- error behavior that is intentional and testable

---

## Test Layers

### Unit tests

Use unit tests for:

- request validation
- protocol serialization
- pagination
- session routing
- readiness checks
- error mapping
- runtime handler behavior that does not require a live editor

### Integration tests

Use integration tests for:

- tool orchestration against mocked or controlled plugin responses
- reconnect behavior
- stale reference handling
- partial batch failures
- runtime tool behavior on the Python/server side

### Contract tests

Use contract tests for the plugin/server boundary:

- handshake and versioning
- command envelope shape
- response and error schema
- readiness and capability signaling
- log and job payload consistency

### Godot-side test suites

Use in-editor GDScript suites for:

- scene and node mutation behavior
- signal, autoload, input, and filesystem handlers
- runtime tools like run/stop and screenshots
- any behavior that depends on actual Godot editor APIs or undo semantics

Built-in guardrails:

- **Zero-assertion detection**: the runner flags any test that completes with 0 assertions as a failure. This catches tests that silently `return` early (e.g. when `scene_root == null`) without exercising any logic.
- **Resilient discovery**: if a `.gd` file fails to parse (duplicate methods, syntax errors, wrong base class), the remaining suites still load and run. Failing files are reported in `load_errors` with a reason string.
- **Suite isolation**: each suite receives a fresh `ctx.duplicate()` so `suite_setup()` mutations cannot leak between suites.
- **CI static check**: `script/ci-check-gdscript` runs `godot --check-only` against every `.gd` file before the editor test run, catching parse errors at the gate.

### End-to-end and release-smoke tests

Run real-project smoke tests for:

- opening a project
- connecting the plugin
- creating or mutating scenes and nodes
- attaching scripts
- running and stopping the project
- reading logs or screenshots
- exporting or otherwise exercising the release surface

### Interactive self-update smoke

Self-update changes require a local interactive smoke because the crash fixed in #250 does not reproduce in headless Godot CI. Run:

```bash
script/local-self-update-smoke
```

The harness prepares a disposable project from the current branch as v(N), builds a synthetic v(N+1) release ZIP with a typed Dict/Array `_exit_tree` trigger, forces the Update banner to install the local ZIP, records the pre-run macOS DiagnosticReports baseline, and launches Godot. The operator step is only to click Update in the dock.

Passing criteria:

- the editor process stays alive without manual or programmatic restart
- the installed fixture plugin version advances to v(N+1)
- `user://godot_ai_update/` is consumed after install
- the update window prints no `SCRIPT ERROR: Parse Error`,
  `ERROR: Failed to load script`, or `Could not resolve script` lines
- no new `Godot*.ips` appears on macOS
- the vNext `_exit_tree` trigger does not print during the update window

Treat this as release-blocking local coverage for self-update, plugin reload handoff, and install/extract changes. It is not a replacement for headless CI; it covers the interactive editor path that CI currently cannot exercise reliably.

---

## What New Tool Families Should Add

The expected coverage depends on the surface:

- simple read tools need unit and integration coverage
- write tools need unit coverage plus Godot-side behavioral tests
- runtime or release tools need smoke coverage in addition to targeted tests
- batch or multi-step tools need explicit partial-failure coverage

If a tool has undo semantics, readiness constraints, or cross-session behavior, those should be tested directly rather than hand-waved in the docs.

---

## CI Expectations

The CI stack should exercise at least four tiers:

- Python unit and integration tests (3 OS x 2 Python versions)
- Godot-side editor test suites (3 OS @ Godot 4.7.0 + a Linux Godot 4.3 canary, via `chickensoft-games/setup-godot@v2` on GitHub Actions runners) — **headless**; no rendering. The 4.3 canary (Phase 1 of #477) guards the documented-minimum engine against the parse-cascade class of regression (#476). Tests that depend on 4.4+-only engine behavior skip via `McpTestSuite.skip_on_godot_lt("4.4", reason)`.
- release-surface smoke, especially install and packaging paths once distribution work is active (3 OS)
- local interactive self-update smoke for update/reload/extract changes (`script/local-self-update-smoke`)
- **pixel-level capture smoke** for tools that cross the editor → game-process boundary (3 OS). The `game-capture-smoke-{linux,macos,windows}` jobs launch Godot with a real rendering driver (`xvfb-run -a ... godot --rendering-driver opengl3` on Linux, windowed on macOS and Windows), play `test_project/capture_smoke.tscn` (four colored quadrants), round-trip `editor_screenshot(source="game")` through the debugger-channel bridge, decode the returned PNG with Pillow, and assert the centre of each quadrant matches the expected color within tolerance. Catches regressions in the `_mcp_game_helper` autoload registration, the `DEFERRED_RESPONSE` dispatcher path, and the `McpConnection.send_deferred_response` reply pipeline — none of which are exercised by the headless Godot test suite.

### CI hardening measures

- **GDScript validation**: `script/ci-check-gdscript` runs after `--import` and before the editor launches. It scans the import log for `SCRIPT ERROR` / `Parse Error` lines and fails the build immediately if any GDScript file has syntax errors. This catches broken scripts before the test runner starts. Strict on every Godot version including the 4.3 canary: the `extends Logger` scripts (4.5+ class) live in the `.gdignore`'d `runtime/loggers/` folder and are compiled from source at runtime by `logger_loader.gd`, so the editor scan never parses them and a clean tree has zero parse errors even on 4.3 — no version-specific allowlist.
- **Step timeouts**: test and smoke steps have `timeout-minutes` set to prevent CI hangs from frozen Godot processes.
- **Filesystem scan settling**: `script/ci-godot-tests` includes a short sleep after editor startup so the filesystem scan completes and test discovery finds all suites.
- **Resilient test discovery**: `test_handler.gd` catches per-file load errors during `_discover_suites()`. A broken test file does not prevent the rest of the suite from running; errors are reported in the response alongside successful results.
- **Regression diagnostics**: `script/ci-find-regression-range` helps identify which commits introduced a CI regression by binary-searching recent history.

This should stay aligned with the release work in [packaging-distribution.md](packaging-distribution.md).

## Future Extensions

Once the project starts targeting more polished game-production workflows, add more verification where it matters:

- screenshot-based regression checks for visibly important surfaces
- runtime-performance spot checks for new diagnostics tools
- benchmark-project smoke checks, especially for the roguelite slice in [implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md)

The goal is not maximal test volume. The goal is enough structured proof that the tool surface can keep growing without turning flaky.
