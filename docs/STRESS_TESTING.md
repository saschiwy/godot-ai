# Stress testing — `script/stormtest.py`

`stormtest` is a concurrency + reload stress harness. It opens many MCP client
connections at once and fires rapid, randomized tool calls across **every**
domain at a live Godot editor, periodically triggering `editor_reload_plugin`
mid-run. It is not a correctness test — it answers two questions:

1. **Does the stack survive sustained concurrent abuse + reload churn without
   crashing?** (editor process, GDScript plugin, WebSocket dispatcher, server)
2. **Where are the latency / error hot-spots per tool?**

It complements the deterministic suites (`pytest`, `test_run`): those check
that each tool is *correct*; stormtest checks that the whole stack is *robust*
under load and across the disable→extract→enable reload window.

## What it does

- **N parallel workers**, each its own `fastmcp.Client` connection (default 8).
- Workers route to the **active session** (empty `session_id`), so when a
  reload rotates the session id they automatically follow the new one.
- **Reads dominate** the op mix (like real traffic); **writes exercise every
  domain** — node/scene/script/batch/material/theme/resource/camera/particle/
  audio/animation/input_map/signal/filesystem.
- Each worker namespaces its writes under `<scene_root>/wN/...` so workers
  hammer one shared edited scene without colliding on node paths.
- **Worker 0 is the "chaos" worker**: every `SS_RELOAD_EVERY` waves it fires
  `editor_reload_plugin` instead of a normal burst, then reconnects (and
  reopens the scratch scene). The other workers keep hammering through the
  reload window and reconnect on the connection drop.
- All disk artifacts (scratch scripts/resources/scene) land under
  `res://_stormtest/` in whatever project the target editor has open — scratch
  material that's safe to delete afterward.

## Safety

- Operates in a throwaway scratch scene (`res://_stormtest/storm.tscn`), **not**
  the project's real scene; restores the originally-open scene on teardown.
- Never calls `project_run`, so it can't autosave-pollute the real scene.
- A full JSON snapshot is flushed to `stormtest_report.json` (in `$TMPDIR`,
  overridable via `SS_REPORT`) **every few seconds**, so a crash or a kill mid-
  run still leaves analyzable data (this is deliberate — an earlier version
  lost its metrics to a `SIGKILL`).
- It does **not** clear logs (a diagnostic must not destroy its own evidence).

## Running

The target editor's MCP server must be reachable (default `:8000`). For a true
test of a branch's code, point the editor at that branch's worktree and serve
that worktree's `src/` (see [Serving a worktree](#serving-a-worktree-code-under-test)
below), so both the GDScript plugin and the Python server are the code under test.

The commands below use `python` and are identical on every OS. `stormtest.py`
re-execs itself into the project `.venv` on launch, so you don't need to
activate the venv or name `.venv/bin/python` vs `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`
first — any `python` on PATH works (opt out with `SS_NO_REEXEC=1`). Host-side
paths are already platform-agnostic.

```bash
# default ≈ 1000 calls, with reload churn, against localhost:8000
python script/stormtest.py

# brutal ≈ 9000 calls
SS_WORKERS=12 SS_WAVES=30 python script/stormtest.py

# reads-only smoke, no reloads
SS_RELOAD=0 SS_WORKERS=4 SS_WAVES=3 python script/stormtest.py

# target a server on another port / host
SS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8010/mcp python script/stormtest.py

# isolated reload survival (single-threaded; the Windows-friendly mode)
SS_RELOAD_MODE=isolated python script/stormtest.py
```

### Serving a worktree (code under test)

The shared `.venv` lives in the root repo and editable-installs the root's
`src/godot_ai`, so a plugin launched from a worktree spawns the *root's* Python
server — worktree Python changes are invisible. The cross-platform launcher
`script/serve_worktree.py` fixes this: it resolves the venv interpreter, prepends
the worktree's `src/` to `PYTHONPATH`, frees the HTTP port, and starts the server
with `--reload` and **both** `--port` and `--ws-port` (so it matches an editor
using non-default port overrides).

```bash
# any OS — pass the editor's HTTP and WS ports
python script/serve_worktree.py --port 8000 --ws-port 9500

# convenience wrappers (same launcher underneath)
script/serve-this-worktree --port 8000 --ws-port 9500        # macOS / Linux
.\script\serve-this-worktree.ps1 --port 18130 --ws-port 19630  # Windows (PowerShell)
```

### Windows / cross-platform notes

The harness and its tooling are cross-platform: the in-editor scratch paths
(`res://_stormtest/…`) use Godot's virtual filesystem, the report path goes
through `tempfile.gettempdir()` / `os.path.join`, the worktree launcher
(`serve_worktree.py`) resolves the venv interpreter and frees the port per-OS,
and `serve-this-worktree.ps1` gives Windows a discoverable serve command. The
report lands in the platform temp dir (`%TEMP%` on Windows); pass an explicit
`SS_REPORT=…` for a known path.

**Reload survival on Windows — use isolated mode:**

```bash
SS_RELOAD_MODE=isolated python script/stormtest.py
```

Isolated mode runs a single-threaded `reload → reconnect → verify-session` loop
with no concurrent load, printing a clean `survived N/N` count and per-reload
recovery time. Prefer it on Windows: the **concurrent** churn mode
(`SS_RELOAD_MODE=concurrent`, the default) can still wedge the asyncio loop when
a *plugin-managed* server is killed mid-reload under concurrent load on Windows —
the loop-wide stall is bounded now (client teardown is hard-capped by
`SS_CLOSE_TIMEOUT`) but not fully root-caused
([#513](https://github.com/hi-godot/godot-ai/issues/513)).

To exercise **concurrent** churn on Windows without a managed server getting
killed, serve the server externally with `--reload` (see
[Serving a worktree](#serving-a-worktree-code-under-test)) and point the editor
at it. Note: a known remaining gap is that `editor_reload_plugin` can still take
down an externally-launched server's process on some setups — making an external
server reliably survive the reload is tracked in
[#514](https://github.com/hi-godot/godot-ai/issues/514).

### Knobs (env)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SS_WORKERS` | 8 | parallel client connections |
| `SS_WAVES` | 5 | waves per worker |
| `SS_CALLS` | 25 | calls per worker per wave |
| `SS_RELOAD` | 1 | include `editor_reload_plugin` churn (`0` to skip) |
| `SS_RELOAD_EVERY` | 2 | chaos worker reloads every N waves (concurrent mode) |
| `SS_RELOAD_MODE` | `concurrent` | `concurrent` churn, or `isolated` single-threaded reload survival loop |
| `SS_ISOLATED_ITERS` | 10 | reload iterations in `isolated` mode |
| `SS_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT` | 30 | seconds to wait for the server to return after a reload |
| `SS_CLOSE_TIMEOUT` | 5 | hard cap (s) on client teardown so a dead-server socket can't wedge the loop |
| `SS_NO_REEXEC` | _(unset)_ | set to skip the auto re-exec into the project `.venv` (run under the current interpreter as-is) |
| `SS_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` | target MCP endpoint |
| `SS_REPORT` | `<platform temp dir>/stormtest_report.json` | where to write the JSON snapshot (temp dir via `tempfile.gettempdir()`; `%TEMP%` on Windows) |

Total calls ≈ `WORKERS × WAVES × CALLS` minus the chaos worker's reload waves.

## Reading the result

On exit (or `Ctrl-C` / `SIGTERM` — it has a graceful handler) it prints:

- **final verdict**: `EDITOR ALIVE` vs `EDITOR DEAD/UNREACHABLE`
- throughput (calls/sec), ok/err totals
- **reloads survived / attempted** and per-reload **recovery time** (wall-clock
  to reconnect)
- overall **latency** p50 / p95 / max
- **error-code histogram** (e.g. `EDITOR_NOT_READY`, `NODE_NOT_FOUND`,
  `INVALID_PARAMS`, `CONNECTION`)
- **per-op table**: ok/err counts, p50/p95/max latency, and the error codes for
  that op

The same data, plus more, is in `stormtest_report.json`.

### Expected (healthy) error noise

A small error rate is normal and *not* a failure:

- `EDITOR_NOT_READY` — transient, during reload windows or play-state changes.
- `NODE_NOT_FOUND` — concurrent-delete races (one worker deletes a node another
  was about to touch); expected under concurrency.
- `CONNECTION` — during the reload disable→enable window before reconnect.

What you're watching for instead: the editor **process dying** (verdict flips to
`DEAD`, a flood of `CONNECTION` that never recovers), a reload that **never
comes back** (managed-server-killed; recovery time unbounded), or one op with a
**pathologically high error rate or latency** that points at a real regression.

> If the target server is plugin-managed (auto-spawned), a reload may kill it
> and not return — run the server **externally** (e.g. `serve-this-worktree`,
> which uses `--reload`) so `editor_reload_plugin` exercises the plugin reload
> without taking the server down with it.
