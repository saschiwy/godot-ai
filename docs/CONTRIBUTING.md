# Contributing to Godot AI

AI assistants working in this repository should read the shared guide in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Client-specific files should point there instead of
duplicating general repo guidance.

## Development Setup

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hi-godot/godot-ai.git
cd godot-ai
script/setup-dev             # creates .venv, installs deps, builds plugin symlink, installs git hooks
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/hi-godot/godot-ai.git
cd godot-ai
.\script\setup-dev.ps1       # creates .venv, installs deps, builds plugin junction, installs git hooks
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> **Plugin link is built locally, not tracked in git.** `test_project/addons/godot_ai`
> is a symlink (Unix) or directory junction (Windows) into `plugin/addons/godot_ai`,
> created fresh by `setup-dev`. A clone without running `setup-dev` has no link and
> Godot won't find the plugin. The Windows flavor uses `mklink /J`, which works
> without admin rights and without Windows Developer Mode.

> **One-time per clone:** `setup-dev` installs a `post-checkout` git hook
> (from `script/githooks/`) into `.git/hooks/`. The hook auto-builds the plugin
> link on every `git worktree add` and `git checkout <branch>`, so every
> future worktree of this clone gets a working link automatically. You only
> need to run `setup-dev` once per clone.

## Testing

### Python tests

```bash
pytest -v                    # unit + integration tests
ruff check src/ tests/       # lint
ruff format src/ tests/      # format
```

### Godot-side tests

GDScript test suites run inside the connected editor via MCP:

```
test_run                     # run all suites
test_run suite=scene         # run one suite
test_results_get             # review last results
```

### CI regression range helper

When CI starts failing, identify the regression window (last green → first red):

```bash
script/ci-find-regression-range hi-godot/godot-ai ci.yml main
```

If your local clone has a valid `origin` GitHub remote, you can omit `owner/repo`:

```bash
script/ci-find-regression-range
```

### Local self-update smoke

For changes that touch self-update, plugin reload handoff, or install/extract logic, run the interactive local harness:

```bash
script/local-self-update-smoke
```

It creates a disposable project with a physical `addons/godot_ai/` copy, stages a synthetic v(N+1) plugin ZIP, launches Godot, and prints the single manual action: click Update in the Godot AI dock. After you close Godot normally, the script verifies the fixture version advanced, the update temp dir was consumed, and no new macOS `Godot*.ips` crash report appeared.

### Self-update compatibility rules

Self-update safety depends on the installed runner. Releases that include the fixed runner write one complete v(N+1) snapshot before Godot scans, so future upgrades from that release avoid mixed old/new script parsing. Users on older releases still take their next update through the old two-phase runner, so release shape still matters during that transition.

- Do not delete a `class_name` declaration that has shipped in any release. If a published class needs to move or retire, leave the original file path and `class_name` in place as a compatibility shim.
- Before cutting a release that may be installed by an old two-phase runner, avoid adding new files that reference constants, methods, or static/non-static shape changes added to existing load-surface scripts in the same release. This applies to `class_name` scripts and preload-only scripts.
- Keep historical old-runner upgrade tests manual or explicitly marked. Default CI should gate the forward fixed-runner path, not permanently fail on old shipped runner behavior.

## Dev Server with Auto-Reload

For Python-side changes without restarting Godot:

```bash
python -m godot_ai --transport streamable-http --port 8000 --reload
```

The Godot AI dock also has a **Start/Stop Dev Server** button when running from a dev checkout.

## PR Workflow

1. Branch off `main`
2. Keep tests and lint clean
3. Add tests for new behavior — both Python and Godot-side when crossing the plugin boundary

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
pytest -v && ruff check src/ tests/
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
gh pr create
```
