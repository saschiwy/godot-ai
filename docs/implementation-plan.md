# Godot AI — Working Plan

*Updated 2026-05-06 (audit-v1 PRs #298–#315 + audit-v2 PRs #369–#390 landed on `beta`. Audit-v1: scene-path ancestry guard, update/config data-loss safeguards, lifecycle reliability, characterization tests, plugin.gd extraction, state-model cleanup, UpdateManager extraction, Runtime Protocol deletion, narrowed meta-tool JSON coercion, self-update preload-alias hardening, locked FastMCP middleware order. Audit-v2: origin allowlist (DNS-rebinding guard), path-traversal guards on `script_*` / `filesystem_*` writes, errno.EADDRINUSE portability, `SessionRegistry` RLock removal, Pydantic-validated WS event payloads, sole-survivor auto-failover, 30s filesystem_changed watchdog during update reload, FAILED_MIXED self-update visibility via `mixed_state`, 32/tick packet-drain cap, error-code vocabulary enrichment (NODE_NOT_FOUND / PROPERTY_NOT_ON_CLASS / VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE / MISSING_REQUIRED_PARAM cut INVALID_PARAMS sites 471 → 97), resolve-or-error helper extraction, resource-form lint for meta-tool reads, LogViewer + PortPickerPanel extraction from `mcp_dock.gd`. Smoke pass on `72b35d7`: 47 GDScript suites + 903 Python tests green.)*

This is the current working plan for Godot AI. It focuses on active and upcoming work only.

## Status Snapshot

- [x] Phase 1 read surface shipped
- [x] Phase 2 safe write surface shipped
- [x] Core Godot-native config tools shipped: `signal.*`, `autoload.*`, `input_map.*`, `project_settings.set`
- [x] Godot-side test harness and `test_run` / `test_results_get` shipped
- [x] Readiness gating and undo integration are in place for the current write surface
- [x] Runtime feedback loop: `project.run`/`project.stop`, `editor.screenshot`, `performance.get_monitors`, `logs.clear`
- [ ] Runtime iteration loop is complete enough for AI-driven feel tuning
- [ ] Release/install path is complete enough for new users
- [~] Polished game-production extensions have started — `ui_*` (anchor presets, `ui_build_layout` composer, `theme_override_*` pseudo-properties, `ui_set_text` cross-Control text setter, `control_draw_recipe` reusable runtime), `theme_*` (color/constant/font-size/stylebox_flat with nested `border`/`corners`/`margins`/`shadow` dicts, `apply`), `animation_*` (AnimationPlayer + `animation_create_simple` composer + delete/validate + overwrite support + four `animation_preset_*` one-call helpers — fade/slide/shake/pulse, undo robust to history interleaving), `material_*` (Standard / ORM / CanvasItem / Shader with enum-by-name + 6 presets), `particle_*` (GPU+CPU 2D+3D with 7 presets, auto-attached billboard draw material so color_ramp renders out of the box), `camera_*` (Camera2D/Camera3D create/configure/limits/damping/follow/get/list + 4 presets, sibling-unmark on `current=true`, one-undo reparent-based follow), `audio_*` (AudioStreamPlayer 1D/2D/3D create/configure/play/stop/list), `resource_*` (built-in Resource instantiation: `create`, `get_info`, `curve_set_points`, `environment_create`, `gradient_texture_create`, `noise_texture_create`, `physics_shape_autofit`) shipped; dedicated `shader_*` CRUD and 3D camera follow (SpringArm3D rig) still pending

## What This Plan Optimizes For

- useful day-to-day Godot editing before breadth
- AI-visible feedback loops before more authoring surface
- Godot-native tool families over generic abstraction
- tight test coverage and live smoke checks for every new surface
- small, composable tools instead of giant action blobs

---

## Current Priority: Finish Phase 3

### Runtime Feedback Loop

- [x] `project.run` with `main`, `current`, and `custom` modes
- [x] `project.stop` with validation (rejects if not playing)
- [x] `editor.screenshot` returning inline MCP ImageContent (viewport/game sources, configurable resolution)
- [x] `editor.screenshot` multi-angle coverage + temporary camera control (`view_target`, `coverage`, `elevation`, `azimuth`, `fov`) with AABB geometry metadata
- [x] `performance.get_monitors` with optional filter (30 Godot Performance monitors)
- [x] `logs.clear`
- [x] WebSocket buffer increase (4 MB) for large payloads like screenshot base64
- [x] `game_manage` — running-game inspection + synthetic input (#470): `get_scene_tree`, `get_node_info`, `input_key`, `input_mouse`, `input_gamepad`, `input_state`. Routed to the live game process via `game_eval` / `game_command` through the `_mcp_game_helper` autoload, so the AI can read the actual runtime scene tree and drive input while the game plays — not just the editor-side scene.

**Why this matters:** Without a reliable launch-observe-inspect loop, the AI can build project structure but cannot tighten feel, readability, or performance.

### High-Leverage Authoring

- [x] `batch.execute` with stop-on-first-error semantics and optional grouped undo
- [x] `node.rename` with sibling-collision validation and char-safety checks (NodePath/script references in OTHER nodes are not auto-updated — documented in the tool). Now also allows renaming the scene root node.
- [x] complex `node.set_property` (`Resource` via res:// path, `NodePath`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, `StringName`)
- [x] `script.patch` shipped — anchor-based `old_text` → `new_text` replace with ambiguity detection and optional `replace_all`

**Why this matters:** These are workflow multipliers. They matter more for real project iteration than adding another narrow read tool.

### Multi-Session Reliability

- [x] reliable multi-instance routing — fixed `SessionRegistry.unregister` silently promoting the first-registered session; reload handler now pins `session_id` explicitly
- [x] clear session selection semantics in tools and UI — `session_activate` accepts substring hints (project folder name / path / session_id) in addition to exact UUID, with ambiguous-match and no-match paths that list candidates
- [x] enough session metadata to distinguish multiple editors safely — added `name` (project basename), `editor_pid`, and `last_seen` heartbeat to every session; surfaced in `session_list`
- [x] per-call session targeting — every Godot-talking tool accepts an optional `session_id`; bound at the `DirectRuntime` layer so `require_writable` and handlers see the pinned session. Lets two AI clients share one server without stomping each other's active.
- [x] human-readable session IDs — `<project-slug>@<4hex>` (e.g. `godot-ai@a3f2`) instead of 32-char random hex. Agents can recognize/remember the target without calling `session_list` first.

**Why this matters:** Real use will quickly involve multiple projects, multiple editor windows, or multiple test sessions. The session model needs to stop being “good enough for one editor.”

### Phase 3 Exit Criteria

- [x] `signal.*`, `autoload.*`, `input_map.*`, `project_settings.set`
- [x] run/stop cycle is reliable
- [x] batch execution is shipped with a clear contract
- [x] multi-instance routing works in practice
- [x] `script.patch` decision is made (shipped: anchor-based replace)
- [x] test coverage and smoke coverage increase where the new runtime loop needs it (903 Python + 1225 GDScript across 47 suites)

---

## Next Priority: Phase 4 Release Path

See [Packaging & Distribution](packaging-distribution.md) for full detail. The short version:

- [x] clean install docs for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, and Antigravity (README + dock auto-configure with manual fallback for 19 clients including Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, Kilo, OpenCode, Zed, Windsurf, VS Code/Insiders, Trae, Kiro, Gemini CLI, Cherry Studio, Qwen Code, Kimi Code)
- [x] PyPI / `uvx` path works reliably — automated via `bump-and-release.yml`; live on PyPI as `godot-ai`; `uvx --from godot-ai~=VERSION godot-ai` is the canonical user-install command. Stdio-only clients (Claude Desktop, Zed) bridge through `uvx mcp-proxy`. Stale-index retries (`--refresh`) and cache priming on self-update prevent flaky first-run failures.
- [ ] desktop binary path is real, not aspirational
- [x] plugin is downloadable from the Godot AssetLib — live as [asset/5050](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/5050) and on the new [Godot Asset Store](https://store.godotengine.org/asset/dlight/godot-ai/); release ZIP workflow ships `godot-ai-plugin.zip` via GitHub Releases; dock self-update banner offers one-click upgrades that survive without an editor restart (`update_reload_runner.gd` handoff). Local self-update smoke (`script/local-self-update-smoke`) is the regression gate.
- [x] CI covers Python tests, Godot-side tests, and release-smoke install paths (3 OS × 2 Python + 3 OS Godot @ 4.7.0 + a Linux Godot 4.3 canary + release-smoke). Linux CI uses `chickensoft-games/setup-godot` on `ubuntu-latest`. GDScript parse validation (`ci-check-gdscript`) runs before tests. Step timeouts prevent hangs. The 4.3 canary (#478, Phase 1 of #477) catches the parse-cascade class of regression on the documented-minimum engine; 4.4+-only tests skip via `McpTestSuite.skip_on_godot_lt(...)`.
- [x] bump-and-release workflow — `gh workflow run bump-and-release.yml -f bump=patch/minor/major` bumps versions, commits, tags, and triggers release build
- [ ] compatibility guidance is published and maintained — README advertises "Godot 4.3+"; 4.3 plugin-load was restored in #476 and is now CI-guarded (4.3 canary). Open gap: in-editor self-update is broken on 4.3 (#475) — manual addon-folder swap is the only clean 4.3 update path; a Update-button gate on < 4.5 is the likely fix.
- [ ] a new user can get from zero to working in under 10 minutes

Release is not just packaging. It is install flow, docs, smoke coverage, and support burden reduction.

## Tool Surface Compactness + Search Friendliness

Two pressures shape the published tool surface: tool-search-aware clients want descriptive names + `defer_loading` so they can find tools by keyword, while non-search clients (Antigravity, etc.) hard-cap at ~40 tools and ignore `defer_loading`.

- [x] audit every tool name for consistent, searchable namespacing (`scene_*`, `node_*`, `script_*`, `signal_*`, `input_map_*`, `editor_*`, `project_*`, `resource_*`, `filesystem_*`, etc.) — no ambiguous or one-off prefixes
- [x] audit every tool description so it contains the keywords a user would naturally use to describe the task (e.g. `screenshot`, `viewport`, `game view`, `input action`, `autoload singleton`) in addition to the Godot term
- [x] audit argument names and argument descriptions — tool search indexes these too
- [x] document which tools should stay non-deferred (the 4 always-loaded core: `editor_state`, `scene_get_hierarchy`, `node_get_properties`, `session_activate`) and mark the rest `defer_loading: true` in the server's MCP advertisement where the protocol permits
- [x] add a short "available tool categories" blurb to the server's MCP server instructions so clients using tool search have a map of what to search for
- [x] verify the published surface still works for clients that do not use tool search (no tool should require a specific discovery path)
- [x] **Collapse 118 MCP tools to ~39 via `<domain>_manage` rollups (PR #203):** each domain exposes one rolled-up tool that takes `op="<verb>"` + a `params` dict, alongside the highest-traffic verbs that stay as named tools. Schema-aware clients still see every op via the dynamic `Literal[...]` enum built by `register_manage_tool` in `src/godot_ai/tools/_meta_tool.py`. Total surface: 4 core + ~15 named verbs + ~20 rollups = ~39 tools.
- [x] **Per-deploy tool exclusion (PR #170/#177):** `--exclude-domains audio,particle,...` CLI flag and `EditorSettings`-backed dock UI drop entire domains for tool-capped clients while keeping the core 4 alive. `tool_catalog.gd` mirrors `domains.py` so the dock can render checkboxes without round-tripping to a running server; CI keeps them in sync via `tests/unit/test_tool_domains.py`.
- [x] **Resource-form reads (`godot://...`):** read-only URIs mirror the cheap reads (`godot://node/{path}/properties`, `godot://script/{path}`, `godot://materials`, etc.) so they don't count against the tool cap. Tool form remains for `session_id`-pinned reads.

**Why this matters:** Once the tool count crosses ~50, clients that load every definition upfront start paying a real context-window tax and the model starts picking wrong tools. The rollup collapse + `--exclude-domains` keeps every client (search-aware or not) under its budget while preserving the full op surface for schema-aware clients.

## Prototype-Driven Extensions

These are not the next things to do blindly. They are the extensions that matter once the runtime loop is solid and the project is ready to prove itself against a more polished game benchmark.

### Tier 1: Needed for Better 2D Game Production

- `ui.*` for HUDs, pause menus, upgrade draft screens, game-over flows, and theme/layout work
  - [x] `ui_set_anchor_preset` — wrap `Control.set_anchors_and_offsets_preset`
  - [x] `ui_build_layout` — declarative nested-dict → atomic Control subtree
  - [x] `theme_create` / `theme_set_color` / `theme_set_constant` / `theme_set_font_size` / `theme_set_stylebox_flat` / `theme_apply` — Theme authoring (Godot's CSS-analog)
  - [ ] `theme_set_stylebox_texture` — 9-slice image-backed styleboxes for pixel-art UI (buttons, panels with real artwork)
  - [ ] `theme_set_font` + `theme_set_icon` — custom typography and icon sets (needs a Font / Texture2D resource handler first)
  - [x] `ui_set_text` convenience — one call to set `.text` across Label / Button / LineEdit / RichTextLabel without remembering per-class property quirks. Shipped as `ui_manage(op="set_text", ...)` (PR #40)
  - [ ] `ui_set_richtext` — set `RichTextLabel.bbcode_text` with optional character-by-character reveal (tween on `visible_characters`). Unlocks terminal-style multi-color log feeds, inline-colored damage numbers, typewriter dialogue — RichTextLabel is currently the only Control with no targeted MCP tool. *(cyberpunk-hud-demo v3.2 polish pass)*
  - [ ] `ui_animate_counter` — tween a numeric Label from an origin to a target value with an optional format string (`"{:,}"`, `"%04d"`, `"HP: %d"`). Wraps `Tween.tween_method` + per-frame label re-render — the fast-forward score / credits / HP counter pattern. *(cyberpunk-hud-demo v3.2 polish pass)*
  - [ ] `control_panel_frame_recipe` — composite sci-fi HUD frame as one recipe: polyline outline with per-corner diagonal cut flags, optional inner double-stroke, chevron header band, bottom ruler ticks, corner flags. Sibling to `control_draw_recipe`. Auto-accounts for parent PanelContainer content_margin so the outline traces the panel's outer edge (resolves friction log [#23](https://github.com/hi-godot/cyberpunk-hud-demo/blob/polish/v2-terminal/docs/friction-log-cyberpunk-hud.md)). *(cyberpunk-hud-demo v3.2 polish pass)*
  - [ ] `node_stylebox_override` — read the parent theme's stylebox for a given slot, duplicate, apply a patch dict, attach via `add_theme_stylebox_override`. Covers the per-instance override pattern: zero borders / corner_radius for an angular frame that takes over the border, or duplicate the HealthBar `fill` stylebox to flash bg_color without mutating the shared theme. *(cyberpunk-hud-demo v3.2 polish pass — used 3× by hand)*
- [~] `camera_*` for follow, bounds, zoom, damping — shipped: `camera_create`, `camera_configure` (class-aware batch), `camera_set_limits_2d` (room bounds), `camera_set_damping_2d` (position/rotation smoothing + drag-margin deadzone), `camera_follow_2d` (reparent-based, one-undo), `camera_get`, `camera_list`, `camera_apply_preset` (topdown_2d, platformer_2d, cinematic_3d, action_3d). `current=true` auto-unmarks siblings of the same class in the same undo action. Pending: `camera_*` 3D follow via `SpringArm3D` rig (3D damping lives there too — Camera3D has no native smoothing) and screen shake (tracked as `animation_preset_shake`)
- `resource.create` / `resource.save` / `resource.instantiate`
- `scene.instantiate` and `scene.inherit`
  - [~] `node_create` now supports a `scene_path` parameter for instancing a `.tscn` as a child node. This covers the basic "instance a prefab" use case. Dedicated `scene.instantiate` (with transform overrides) and `scene.inherit` (inherited scenes) are still pending for full reusable-scene workflows.
- `animation_player.*` / `animation_tree.*`
  - [~] AnimationPlayer scaffolding shipped (`animation_player_create`, `animation_create`, `animation_add_property_track`, `animation_add_method_track`, `animation_set_autoplay`, `animation_play`, `animation_stop`, `animation_list`, `animation_get`, `animation_create_simple` composer, `animation_delete`, `animation_validate`). `animation_create` and `animation_create_simple` support `overwrite` parameter for re-creating animations in place.
  - [x] **Preset helpers** — `animation_preset_fade`, `animation_preset_slide`, `animation_preset_shake`, `animation_preset_pulse` shipped (PR #39) as `animation_manage(op="preset_*", ...)`. Thin wrappers over `animation_create_simple` that bake in the right transition / loop_mode / two-keyframe shape for each effect. Cuts a "fade in this Panel" from a 6-line tween spec to one call.
    - **Notes from cyberpunk-hud-demo v3.2 polish pass (2026-04-19):**
      - `animation_preset_pulse_loop` should take a `property` arg (default `scale`, but `modulate:a`, `modulate`, `self_modulate`, `position`, and arbitrary sub-paths all came up). The existing `animation_preset_pulse` is scale-only — blocks modulate-alpha breathing, color pulses, position jitter. See friction log [#15](https://github.com/hi-godot/cyberpunk-hud-demo/blob/polish/v2-terminal/docs/friction-log-cyberpunk-hud.md).
      - Five additional presets surfaced as hand-written `_process(delta) { phase += ...; queue_redraw() }` loops during the pass, each a one-call op if bundled:
        - `animation_preset_bounce` — center-pivot scale overshoot with elastic settle (UI press feedback, Q/E/R-style affordances). Auto-sets `pivot_offset = size * 0.5` so the pop originates from the icon, not the top-left (subtle foot-gun today).
        - `animation_preset_orbit` — position traversing a rect or circle perimeter at a phase rate, optional inward inset (orbiting "data packet" dots, HUD satellite markers).
        - `animation_preset_sweep` — rotating arc-segment comet on a Control (cooldown-ring accents, radar scan overlays).
        - `animation_preset_drift` — phase-driven position offset on one axis (CRT scanlines, marquee text, conveyor belts).
        - Text counter is covered separately by `ui_animate_counter` above.
  - [ ] **Bezier and audio tracks** — `animation_add_bezier_track` (for hand-tuned curves where keyframe interpolation isn't enough) and `animation_add_audio_track` (timed AudioStreamPlayer cues; needs the audio resource handler first).
  - [ ] **`animation_tree.*`** — state-machine and blend-tree authoring for character locomotion (idle ↔ walk ↔ run blends, attack one-shots). Larger surface; depends on the AnimationPlayer being solid first.
  - [ ] **3D material fades / sub-resource paths** — animating a 3D mesh's transparency means tweening `MeshInstance3D:material_override:albedo_color`, which the value coercer needs to walk into. Today it falls through to raw value for nested resource paths. Requires extending `_coerce_value_for_track` to resolve `node:resource:property` chains, plus a worked example in the docstring.
  - [ ] **Coercion gaps for non-UI types** — `_coerce_for_type` currently handles Color / Vector2 / Vector3 / int / float / bool. Missing: `Transform3D` / `Quaternion` / `Basis` (3D rigging), `Vector3i` (TileMap), `NodePath` / `StringName` (prop-redirection animations), `Rect2` / `AABB`. Today these silently store the raw JSON value and play garbage. Fix is local to one function; the test plan is the harder bit (need fixture nodes for each property type).
  - [ ] **Library-keyed access** — current API targets the default library only. Multi-library workflows (e.g. importing a glTF skeleton with named clip libraries) need explicit `library` params on `animation_create` / `animation_add_*_track` / `animation_play`. Low priority — most users won't hit this.
- `audio.*`

### Tier 2: Strong Polish Multipliers

- [x] `material_*` — StandardMaterial3D / ORMMaterial3D / CanvasItemMaterial / ShaderMaterial authoring shipped. Tools: `material_create`, `material_set_param`, `material_set_shader_param`, `material_get`, `material_list`, `material_assign` (with `create_if_missing`), `material_apply_to_node` (inline material builder, one-undo), `material_apply_preset` (metal, glass, emissive, unlit, matte, ceramic). Enum-by-name coercion for transparency / shading_mode / blend_mode / cull_mode / etc. Shader uniform setting via `material_set_shader_param` drives arbitrary `.gdshader` parameters.
- [x] `particle_*` — GPUParticles2D/3D + CPUParticles2D/3D shipped with 7 presets (`fire`, `smoke`, `spark_burst`, `magic_swirl`, `rain`, `explosion`, `lightning`). Tools: `particle_create`, `particle_set_main`, `particle_set_process` (auto-creates `ParticleProcessMaterial` in-one-undo if missing), `particle_set_draw_pass` (grows `draw_passes` count + auto-default QuadMesh if slot empty), `particle_restart`, `particle_get`, `particle_apply_preset`. Every auto-create draw pass gets a billboard `StandardMaterial3D` with `vertex_color_use_as_albedo=true` so `color_ramp` actually renders — the default Godot draw pass has no material and silently ignores the gradient.
- [ ] `shader.*` for CRUD on `.gdshader` files (currently shaders can only be created by writing them via `filesystem_write_text` and loading with `material_set_shader_param`)
- `physics.*` helpers for layers, masks, bodies, and common 2D setup
- light `tilemap.*` and/or `navigation.*` if the benchmark moves from a single arena to authored rooms

### Tier 3: Verification and Shipping Support

- `build.*`
- richer performance diagnostics
- more capture and regression-verification helpers where they materially help iteration
- `editor_viewport_*` — toggle per-viewport display options that live outside the scene (e.g. View Environment / View Gizmos, Preview Sun, Preview Environment, grid visibility, orthogonal vs. perspective). Useful when the AI needs the editor grid visible, or wants to disable the default sky to judge lighting. These are editor-only state, not scene state, so they require a dedicated surface rather than `node_set_property`.

**The rule here is simple:** Do not add broad polish tooling before the AI can already launch the game, inspect results, and make safe iterative edits.

## First Prototype Benchmark: Top-Down Roguelite

Use a small 2D top-down roguelite as the first benchmark, but keep it room-based or arena-based rather than jumping straight to full procedural dungeons.

### Benchmark Scope

- one player character with move, shoot, and dash
- three enemy archetypes
- one boss or final survival spike
- XP or currency pickups
- 10-15 upgrades presented through a draft or choice screen
- one arena with escalating waves or 3-5 short rooms
- HUD, pause, death, restart, and upgrade UI
- placeholder art is acceptable
- unreadable combat feedback is not acceptable

### What The Current Stack Can Already Do

- [x] build an ugly but functional arena prototype with nodes, scripts, resources, input, autoloads, signals, and tests
- [x] create and mutate small Godot projects safely in the editor
- [ ] support the kind of runtime iteration needed to make the benchmark feel good

### UI Scenarios The Current Stack Can Already Scaffold

With `ui_set_anchor_preset`, `ui_build_layout`, and the `theme_*` authoring
family in place, an agent can one-shot a styled, anchored, undoable Control
tree for each of these benchmark-relevant UI surfaces — `theme_*` defines the
look once, `ui_build_layout` places it, `signal_connect` wires behavior:

- **Roguelite HUD** — health bottom-left, ammo bottom-right, score / boss bar top-center, minimap / combo top-right; one theme applied at `/Main/HUD` styles everything inside
- **Pause menu overlay** — full-rect dim panel, centered `VBoxContainer` with Resume / Settings / Quit buttons, themed hover/pressed states
- **Upgrade-draft screen** — centered bordered `Panel` with three side-by-side `Button` cards; rounded corners, drop shadow, and border from one `theme_set_stylebox_flat`
- **Game-over screen** — dim overlay, YOU DIED label, stats `Label` filled by the game script, Retry / MainMenu / Quit button row
- **Settings menu** — dialog panel with labeled slider rows (`HBoxContainer` of Label + HSlider) for master/music/SFX volume, fullscreen `CheckBox`, uniform spacing via `theme_set_constant`
- **Dialogue box** — `bottom_wide` panel with portrait `TextureRect`, name + message `RichTextLabel`, continue hint; game code mutates `.text` per line
- **Main menu** — logo top-center, title centered, vertical stack of nav buttons
- **Inventory grid** — `GridContainer` of themed `Panel` slots each holding an icon `TextureRect` and quantity `Label`; re-skinnable by swapping the theme
- **Tutorial prompt** — small themed `Panel` anchored where the tutorial wants it, styled key-cap via stylebox, text mutated as the tutorial progresses
- **Boss overlay** — `top_wide` panel with name Label, wide `ProgressBar` for health, horizontal row of phase indicators; phase color changes via a single `theme_set_color` update
- **Sliding pause menu** — `animation_create_simple` tweens `PauseMenu:position` from off-screen left to center with `ease_out`; `loop_mode="none"`; `animation_set_autoplay` omitted so script triggers it on pause input
- **Hover pulse on buttons** — `animation_create_simple` tweens `Button:scale` from `{x:1,y:1}` to `{x:1.08,y:1.08}` with `loop_mode="pingpong"`; autoplay starts immediately
- **Damage shake on HUD root** — property track on `HUD:position` with rapid keyframes at ±8px offsets over 0.3s; triggered by script on `player_hit` signal
- **Fade transition between UI screens** — `animation_create_simple` tweens `TransitionRect:modulate` from `{a:0}` to `{a:1}` (fade to black), then a method track calls `emit_signal("fade_complete")` at the midpoint

Each of these is now a single-prompt target. What these scenarios still
cannot express is: sound feedback, custom fonts, and pixel-art 9-slice buttons. Those are blocked by
the `audio.*` / `theme_set_font` / `theme_set_stylebox_texture` gaps
tracked above.

### What Must Exist Before This Is A Fair Benchmark

- [x] run/stop plus screenshot capture and basic performance sampling
- [x] `batch.execute` and a safe partial-edit story
- [ ] data-authoring surface for upgrades, enemies, room data, and reusable scenes
- [~] `ui.*` for HUD and upgrade selection — anchor presets, declarative `ui_build_layout` composer, `ui_set_text`, `control_draw_recipe` runtime, and `theme_*` authoring shipped; still need `theme_set_font`, `theme_set_stylebox_texture` for pixel-art / custom typography
- [~] `camera_*` for follow, bounds, zoom, damping — 2D surface shipped (see Tier 1 above); 3D follow / SpringArm3D rig and screen shake (`animation_preset_shake`) still pending
- [x] `animation_player.*` shipped; `audio.*` shipped (`audio_player_create` 1D/2D/3D + `set_stream`/`set_playback`/`play`/`stop`/`list` under `audio_manage`)
- [~] `material_*` and `particle_*` shipped (see Tier 2 above); still need a dedicated `shader_*` CRUD surface for `.gdshader` editing outside of `filesystem_write_text`
- [~] light `physics.*` started (`physics_shape_autofit` op under `resource_manage` derives a `Shape2D`/`Shape3D` from a target node's bounds and walks parent-siblings); still need layer/mask/body helpers, plus optional `tilemap.*` / `navigation.*` if rooms become more authored

### Versioned Milestones (v1 / v2 / v3)

The benchmark isn't a single "done" switch. It's three readable gates, each composed from capabilities already tracked in this file. Climbing the ladder is the same as landing Tier 1 → 2 → 3 tools above.

#### v1 — "Ugly but playable"

Matches what the current stack can already produce (see "What The Current Stack Can Already Do" above).

- one arena, move + shoot (dash deferred to v2)
- one enemy archetype, no boss
- flat-color HUD (health + score) via `ui_build_layout` + `theme_set_stylebox_flat`
- pause overlay, death → restart loop
- no particles, no audio, no screen shake
- AI authors the whole loop end-to-end and launches it via `project_run`
- **Goal:** prove end-to-end AI authoring of a complete gameplay loop on today's tool surface.

#### v2 — "Readable and juicy"

Unlocks once Tier 2 tools land (most already shipped — `particle_*`, `material_*`, `animation_player.*`).

- dash ability with trail particle + brief `modulate` fade on the player
- three enemy archetypes, XP / currency pickups
- 10–15 upgrades presented via a draft screen (see UI pattern for "Upgrade-draft screen" above)
- hit-flash via `animation_create_simple` modulate tween; muzzle flash via `particle_apply_preset "spark_burst"`; death via `"explosion"`
- screen shake via the damage-shake animation pattern on HUD root
- sliding pause menu + hover pulse animations on buttons
- **Goal:** combat feel + meta progression loop readable enough to iterate on.

#### v3 — "Shippable slice"

Requires the remaining Tier 1 gaps (`camera.*`, `audio.*`) plus Tier 3 shipping support (`build.*`).

- `camera.*` follow + bounds + shake, replacing the v2 HUD-shake stand-in
- `audio.*` SFX for shoot / hit / dash / pickup, plus a music bed
- boss encounter OR escalating-wave survival spike
- 3–5 authored rooms (if `tilemap.*` / `navigation.*` lands) or a single polished arena with a wave system
- main menu and settings menu with volume sliders
- desktop export via `build.*` without bespoke handholding
- **Goal:** meets all four Benchmark Exit Criteria below.

**How this ladder composes with the tier list:** a Tier 1/2/3 checkbox landing is not progress on its own — v1/v2/v3 are the gates where we stop and verify the capability actually produces a shippable feel. Tools enable versions; versions validate tools.

### Asset Sourcing Strategy

"Placeholder art is acceptable" above is easy to misread as "we have an asset pipeline gap." We don't — for v1 and v2. This subsection states what the AI actually uses per version, and answers the recurring question of whether we need a dedicated texture-generation tool in this repo.

#### Per-version asset sources

- **v1 — Primitives only, no image files.**
  - UI is `ColorRect`, `Panel`, and `theme_set_stylebox_flat` — solid colors, rounded corners, no textures.
  - Gameplay uses `Sprite2D` with `PlaceholderTexture2D`, or `Polygon2D` / shape-based visuals. Colored flat-shade `StandardMaterial3D` if anything 3D sneaks in.
  - Particle colors come from the gradient presets already baked into `particle_apply_preset` — the `GradientTexture1D` is generated inside the handler, no asset file needed.
  - **The AI ships v1 without reading or writing a single `.png`.** Contributors should stop worrying about an art pipeline at this stage.

- **v2 — Procedural + built-in textures.**
  - Godot-native procedural texture resources via `resource_create`: `NoiseTexture2D` (noise backgrounds, particle sprites), `GradientTexture2D` (radial glows, health-bar fills), `PlaceholderTexture2D` (anything with a size hint).
  - Shader-based visuals for hit-flash, dash trail, and damage vignette via `material_set_shader_param` plus a `.gdshader` written through `filesystem_write_text`.
  - **Still no binary image files.** This is a recipes-only stage — the tools already exist.

- **v3 — Real art drops in.**
  - Pixel-art sprites, 9-slice UI buttons, custom fonts, SFX / music are binary files the AI cannot author directly. Three sourcing paths, priority order:
    1. **CC0 asset packs** (Kenney, itch.io). AI suggests a pack, user drops the folder into `res://assets/`, AI calls `filesystem_reimport` and wires references. No new tooling in this repo.
    2. **External image-gen MCP server** composed alongside `godot-ai`. Any image-gen MCP with a file-write tool can produce a PNG on disk inside the project, then `filesystem_reimport` picks it up. No new tooling in this repo.
    3. **SVG icon set** via `theme_set_icon` (tracked above, pending). SVG is text, so `filesystem_write_text` can author simple geometric icons directly.

#### Do we need a separate `texture_*` / image-gen tool here?

**Default answer: no.** The reasoning:

- **Image generation is out of scope for an editor-integration server.** Bundling model-calling logic into `godot-ai` drags in API keys, credit accounting, and model-vendor choice. The `filesystem_reimport` tool already exists so an external image-gen MCP can drop a PNG on disk and have Godot pick it up.
- **"Texture adjust" is a shader concern, not an asset concern.** `CanvasItemMaterial` / `ShaderMaterial` / `modulate` / `self_modulate` are all reachable today.
- **Weak case for one helper — `resource_create_procedural_texture`:** a thin wrapper that creates `NoiseTexture2D` / `GradientTexture2D` / `PlaceholderTexture2D` with sensible defaults and saves to a `res://` path. These are the three most common v2 needs and today require multi-step `resource_create` + property-set sequences. Deferred — build it only if a real v2 attempt shows the multi-step version is painful.
- **Revisit trigger:** if v3 sourcing via external image-gen MCP proves unreliable in practice (latency, quality, auth friction), revisit whether a bundled `texture_gen` tool belongs here. Don't speculatively build it.

### Benchmark Exit Criteria

- [ ] Godot AI can author the project structure, gameplay scenes, and data assets with limited manual cleanup
- [ ] the AI can launch the game, inspect results, and tighten feel over repeated iterations
- [ ] a human reviewer would call the slice readable and juicy, not just functional
- [ ] the prototype can be exported to a desktop build without bespoke handholding

## What We Are Not Doing Yet

- using the implementation plan as a historical changelog
- promising exhaustive tool coverage before the core loop is strong
- benchmarking with a full procedural dungeon crawler before the arena/room loop works
- building genre-specific high-level DSLs before the general authoring surface is good enough
